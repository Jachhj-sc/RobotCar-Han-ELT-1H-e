# RobotCar-Han
This repository is for managing all the code for the robotcar project.

in here here you can add a general description of the repository.

#the layout

for the layout please see the layout directory where i added pictures on how to upload your source files.
the library files should be in a Folder representing the name, then in that folder should be the .h and .c files,
and in the main folder should be a main.c with an example that should show a working example of the library.

--ONLY UPLOAD CODE IN THE personal BRANCH--
if you want to upload not working code upload it to a new branch. and only merge it when it works.

if your code is working you can file a pull request but let the pull request be accepted by someone else, for example the person that you are helping. 
this helps prevent unwanted code changes. if you want to help somebody create a separate branch from there personal branch and you can start editing and when its done you can create a pull request with their personal branch.  and when everything is done you can make a pullrequest for main.
